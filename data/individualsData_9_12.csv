Kimpton Distinguished Service Professor of History and South Asian Studies at the University of Chicago. With 'Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference' (2000),  probably his best-known work, the Indian-born historian and co-founder of the journal Subaltern Studiescontributed significantly to a critique of Eurocentrism in the humanities and social sciences, but at the same time drew attention to the difficulties of overcoming it. In 2014 he received the prestigious Toynbee Foundation Prize for his contributions to global history. His most recent interest is in the Anthropocene debate and the associated challenges for a historical science that has to reconsider its traditional separation of human and natural history","1.

His writing and teaching focus on the theoretical, conceptual and methodological dimensions of urban questions, and on the challenges of reinventing our approach to urbanization in relation to the crises, contradictions and struggles of our time.  Brenner has made influential contributions to scholarly debates on critical urban theory, the critique of capitalist urbanization, urban restructuring, state space, the political economy of rescaling, variegated neoliberalization and planetary urbanization.  His current work is focused on the question of how “hinterlands”—the non-city territories, infrastructures and ecologies that support urban life—are being remade under contemporary supply-chain capitalism.  This inquiry aims to connect the study of urbanization more directly to the analysis not only of primary commodity production (the historical geographies of agro-industrial and extractive capitalism) but also to the critical exploration of contemporary environmental crises and emergent struggles for postfossil—and postcapitalist—planetary futures.
