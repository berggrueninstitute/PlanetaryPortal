It is a forum for scientific policy advice at the nexus of global environmental change and health with the aim of achieving a sustainable and equitable transformation of social systems in Germany and the world. With CPHP we are aiming to stimulate and support socio-political debates on health within planetary boundaries. Together with health actors, policy-makers, and researchers, we develop options for action along the questions depicted in our first policy brief and others. For example: How can planetary health as a vision for the future be established as a standing item on national and international political agendas permanently and effectively? How can health equity and environmental justice be consolidated in (health) policy decisions? What kind of partnerships are necessary for planetary health? In addition to that, we want to connect with actors from other policy fields; because health is not only shaped by the health sector but all policy areas. To that end, we will also look beyond Germany. In view of the urgency of overcoming the planetary crises, new forms of cooperation are needed to ensure the habitability of the planet for future generations and their health.",Maike Voss (Director),"Planetary, health, sustainability, planetary boundaries, socio-political, justice, healthcare","

By thinking extradisciplinary, we acknowledge the limits and faults of our discipline and advocate for processes of unlearning to be able to learn something new.

In summary, SAVVY Contemporary gives space to reflect on colonialities of power (Anibal Quijano) and how these affect histories, geographies, gender and race.

The Institute's researchers explore the changing meaning of fundamental scientific concepts (for example number, force, heredity, space) as well as how cultural developments shape fundamental scientific practices (for example argument, proof, experiment, classification). They examine how bodies of knowledge originally devised to address specific local problems became universalized.

The work of the Institute's scholars forms the basis of a theoretically oriented history of science which considers scientific thinking from a variety of methodological and interdisciplinary perspectives.

2. The challenges and threats we face today are complex, changing and increasingly unpredictable, and the need to address them is more urgent than ever.
3. We need to make a qualitative leap in our knowledge and understanding of the issues, as well as in global governance and collective decision-making, in order to find and implement effective solutions. This leap can only be made by embracing a new approach that enables us to work integratively, drawing on the various disciplines of our current knowledge.
4. These solutions exist; finding them is not an impossible challenge.

Based on this vision, the university has made a firm commitment to contribute to this planetary goal by blurring the boundaries between disciplines, departments and units.

The institute draws on a history of advanced interdisciplinary research at Wits that dates back to the late 1960s, but over the last decade, in particular, it has pursued five main objectives with distinctive energy and enterprise. These are: to foster independent, critical inquiry into the complexities and paradoxes of change in South Africa; to conduct this enquiry by drawing intensively on comparative international research especially from the African continent; to foreground the global theoretical significance of WISER’s research agenda; to combine aesthetic and social scientific analyses; and to provide an institutional space that strengthens the scholarly dialogue between South African researchers and academics in the rest of the world. In all these areas WISER has achieved very significant success. For many years the institute has succeeded in addressing both a local, popular audience interested in the post-Apartheid moment and a large global scholarly network.","Sarah Nutall (Director and Professor)
